## Romanov Escapes

In this point and click adventure game you take control of Tsar Nicholas II on the night of July 13th, 1918. Help your family escape the House of Special Purpose in Yekaterinburg, Siberia by solving a series of puzzles and dilemmas. Guarding this “Ipatiev House” is the Ural Regional Soviet, a group of Bolshevik revolutionaries under the command of Commandant Yakov Yurovsky. On that fateful night a group of Red Army defectors sought to take control of Yekaterinburg, leading to a night of chaos and distant gunfire. Diverging from history, this game depicts an escape attempt that could have been taken by the Romanov family had they capitalized on the events of July 13. 

The Romanov Escape features a map accurately modeling the Ipatiev House with the proper locations of key items on that night.

Sneak, fight, fool, steal, and talk the Romanovs’ way out of the Ipatiev House and secure their freedom!
