# HAGJ8-RomanovGame

## Romanov Escapes
In this point and click adventure game, take control of Tsar Nicholas II in that fateful year of 1918 and help your family escape from the clutches of the Ural Regional Soviets. You are being held captive in the Ipatiev house in Yekaterinburg, Siberia by the Bolsheviks and are denied access to the outside world. Hopeful that they would be set free, the Romanov family held out until the bitter end until they were executed in 1918. This game is a slight alternate history that takes place on July 13, 1918 when riots were breaking out in the nearby town. This alternate history asks the question of what if the Romanov family chose to break out while the guards were distracted by the happenings in the town.\

Featuring a historical recreation of the Ipatiev house layout and some minor historical changes.\

Find the path to freedom. Take control of the head of the family and help your family escape their fateful demise.\
